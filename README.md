# Directory and File Management

This project consists of a series of exercises that demonstrate directory and file management in Java. The exercises cover listing directory contents, recursive directory traversal, file reading and writing, and object serialization.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Create a class that lists the contents of a given directory alphabetically.

### Exercise 2
Enhance the class from Exercise 1 to include functionality for listing a directory tree with contents at all levels (recursively). The output should be displayed alphabetically within each level, indicating whether each item is a directory (D) or a file (F), along with its last modified date.

### Exercise 3
Modify the previous exercise to save the output to a TXT file instead of displaying it on the screen.

### Exercise 4
Add functionality to read any TXT file and display its content on the console.

### Exercise 5
Implement serialization of a Java object to a `.ser` file and subsequently deserialize it.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
